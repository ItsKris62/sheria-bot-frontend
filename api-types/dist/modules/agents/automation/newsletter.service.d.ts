     * 2-step requestSendConfirmation -> executeSend flow expects a live human

     * queueOutreach avoids that problem only because SuppressionList is keyed
     * by raw email, not by the Contact model dependency this would still need
     * to route through, and marketing consent semantics for a broadcast
     * newsletter aren't the same question as one outreach email to an existing
     * customer contact. This needs a product decision (schema change for raw-
     * HTML campaigns? Reuse an existing template? Direct send bypassing
     * campaign tracking, accepting the consent-check gap?), not a guess.
